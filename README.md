# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The course project for Getting and Cleaning Data involves collecting, working 
with, and cleaning a data set on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

The data source for this data set is located on the following website:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

In order to generate the tidy data set output for this project, execute the R 
script named run_analysis. Note that it requires the reshape2 package, which 
can be downloaded from CRAN.

The output of the R script is a tidy data set named tidy.txt.

Additional details on the data, variables, and steps taken to create the 
tidy data set are available in the Code Book.
