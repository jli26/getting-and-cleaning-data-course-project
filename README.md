## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 - Couse Project

The course project for Getting and Cleaning Data involves collecting, working 
with, and cleaning a data set on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

In order to generate the tidy data set for this project, execute the R script 
named run_analysis. Note that it requires the reshape2 package, which can be 
downloaded from CRAN.

The output of the R script is a tidy data set named tidy.csv.

Additional details on the data set are available in the code book.
